This Repo contains 4 different methods of approximation, those being an approximation for a square root, the bisection method, the fixed-point method, and the Newton-Raphson method.
Each method is labeled by its title followed by dashed lines to make searching easier.
The main folder contains the general algorithms without values put in to make them work, as well as comments about where and how to input values.
The test folder contains the methods with specific inputs as seen in our lecture PowerPoints.
To use a method, copy and paste your method of choice into a compiler (along with any necessary libraries).
NOTE: All methods require the use of Math, but Newton also requires sympy, it should be copied along with the rest of the method.
